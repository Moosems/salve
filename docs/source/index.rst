``Salve IPC`` Documentation
===========================

Welcome to ``Salve IPC``'s Documentation! ``Salve IPC`` is a library that can be used by code editors to easily get autocompletions, replacements, editorconfig suggestions, definitions, and syntax highlighting. It does this with a simple yet very powerful API while doing all major work in a seperate process to keep the main thread free and fast. To get started with Salve, visit the :doc:`installation` page!

.. note::

   This project is under active development and the API will reach its stable form at v1.0.0
