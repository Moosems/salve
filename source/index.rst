Welcome to Salve's Documentation!
=================================

**Salve IPC** is a library that can be used by code editors to easily get autocompletions, replacements, editorconfig suggestions, definitions, and syntax highlighting and more. It does this with a simple yet very powerful API while doing all major work in a seperate process to keep the main thread free and fast.

.. note::

   This project is under active development and the API will reach its stable development at v1.0.0
